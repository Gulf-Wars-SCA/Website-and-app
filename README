This is the Gulf Wars Website GitHub.
We will primarily be using this as an issue tracker and guide for users of the app, as well as for issues affecting both app users and the administrative team running the war. This will include topics such as:

Tips for using the website and the PWA app embedded within the site, including troubleshooting installs and use.
How to add, modify, or remove activities from the various area calendars on the site and the app.
Who to contact if you have an issue.
Finally, a note: This GitHub is a work in progress.
